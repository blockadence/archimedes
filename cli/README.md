# archimedes (CLI)

Compiled replacement for `template/scripts/*.sh`, installable once, globally,
independent of any instance. An instance becomes pure data (`repos.yaml`,
`repos/*.md`, `work/`) — this binary is the only thing that acts on it.

## Build / install

```
go build ./cmd/archimedes            # local binary at ./archimedes
go install ./cmd/archimedes          # installs `archimedes` to $GOBIN
```

## Adding a subcommand

Each subcommand lives in its own `internal/cmd/<name>.go`, exposing a
`new<Name>Cmd() *cobra.Command` constructor registered in
`internal/cmd/root.go`'s `newRootCmd`. Business logic belongs in its own
`internal/<package>`, kept independent of cobra/CLI concerns, so it can be
unit-tested directly (see `internal/workspacemap` for the pattern the
`render-map` subcommand follows).

Anything that shells out to `git` goes through `internal/gitutil` rather
than calling `exec.Command("git", ...)` directly, so "run git and interpret
the result" lives in one place. Helpers that more than one subcommand needs
— deriving a repo's `owner/name` slug from its origin remote, removing a
worktree or branch — belong there too. Tests are exempt: a test that builds
a git fixture drives git directly, so a bug in `gitutil` can't hide itself
by also breaking the fixture.

## Status

Walking skeleton, growing one subcommand at a time from `template/scripts/*.sh`:

- `bootstrap` — port of `template/scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- `render-map` — port of `template/scripts/render-map.sh`
- `context-map` — port of `template/scripts/context-map-all.sh` (plus
  `run-driver.sh`, as `internal/driver`)
- `spawn` — port of `template/scripts/spawn.sh`
- `status` — port of `template/scripts/status.sh`
- `prune` — port of `template/scripts/prune.sh`

`bootstrap` discovers a GitHub org's repos, clones the ones not already
checked out beside the instance, and scaffolds each one's `repos.yaml` entry
and dossier stub before regenerating `WORKSPACE-MAP.md`. Every step is
idempotent, since re-running as the org grows is the normal case: an entry
already listed, a checkout already present, and a dossier already written are
each left exactly as they are, so a run that discovers nothing new leaves the
instance byte-for-byte unchanged.

Scaffolded entries spell out every per-repo field, including the ones nothing
sets yet (`convention_pack`, `driver`, `depends_on`, `context_modeled_sha`) —
declaring a convention pack is filling in a key that's already there rather
than remembering its name. `repos.yaml` is edited as a YAML node tree rather
than re-marshalled, so its comments and any fields the CLI doesn't model
survive the rewrite.

`spawn` creates the branch and worktree for one unit of work in one target
repo. It always fetches first, so a branch starts from current remote state
rather than a stale local checkout, and resolves its start point with the
same precedence the script used (`--stack-on` over `--base` over the repo's
own base branch). It then materializes the unit of work's reference material
plus the target repo's house rules into the worktree's `.archimedes/`, under
the no-commit guarantee (see `internal/spawn/materialize.go`).

`status` reads every `work/<slug>/status.md`, looks up each row's live PR
state via `gh pr list`, and prints the same fixed-width table the shell
script did (or `--json` for a machine-readable report). A row's PR lookup
degrading to "no PR" — a missing `gh` auth, no network, an unset repo — never
fails the rest of the report, matching the original script's `|| echo '{}'`
fallback.

`prune` removes worktrees, branches, and status rows for units of work whose
PR has merged or closed. It's a dry run unless `--force` is passed, and it
refuses to remove a branch still acting as another unit of work's stacked
base.

`context-map` sequences a mapping pass across every repo, dependency/base
repos first, skipping any repo already current for its base branch's latest
commit (`--dry-run` reports that plan without acting on it). It splits the
same two ways the scripts did: `internal/contextmap` decides *which* repos
need mapping and in what order, `internal/driver` knows *how* to invoke one
driver — so swapping the configured driver never touches orchestration, and
neither half hardcodes any particular driver. Which driver runs is resolved
most-specific-first: a repo's own `driver` field, then `repos.yaml`'s
top-level one, then `ARCHIMEDES_DRIVER`; with none set, each repo becomes an
interactive session the operator confirms. Recording a repo as mapped goes
through `manifest.SetRepoField`, sharing the node-tree editing described
above so a hand-maintained `repos.yaml` survives the rewrite.
