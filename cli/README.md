# archimedes (CLI)

Compiled replacement for `template/scripts/*.sh`, installable once, globally,
independent of any instance. An instance becomes pure data (`repos.yaml`,
`repos/*.md`, `work/`) — this binary is the only thing that acts on it.

## Build / install

```
go build ./cmd/archimedes            # local binary at ./archimedes
go install ./cmd/archimedes          # installs `archimedes` to $GOBIN
```

## Adding a subcommand

Each subcommand lives in its own `internal/cmd/<name>.go`, exposing a
`new<Name>Cmd() *cobra.Command` constructor registered in
`internal/cmd/root.go`'s `newRootCmd`. Business logic belongs in its own
`internal/<package>`, kept independent of cobra/CLI concerns, so it can be
unit-tested directly (see `internal/workspacemap` for the pattern the
`render-map` subcommand follows).

Anything that shells out to `git` goes through `internal/gitutil` rather
than calling `exec.Command("git", ...)` directly, so "run git and interpret
the result" lives in one place. Helpers that more than one subcommand needs
— deriving a repo's `owner/name` slug from its origin remote, removing a
worktree or branch — belong there too. Tests are exempt: a test that builds
a git fixture drives git directly, so a bug in `gitutil` can't hide itself
by also breaking the fixture.

## Status

Walking skeleton, growing one subcommand at a time from `template/scripts/*.sh`:

- `render-map` — port of `template/scripts/render-map.sh`
- `spawn` — port of `template/scripts/spawn.sh`
- `status` — port of `template/scripts/status.sh`
- `prune` — port of `template/scripts/prune.sh`

`spawn` creates the branch and worktree for one unit of work in one target
repo. It always fetches first, so a branch starts from current remote state
rather than a stale local checkout, and resolves its start point with the
same precedence the script used (`--stack-on` over `--base` over the repo's
own base branch). It then materializes the unit of work's reference material
plus the target repo's house rules into the worktree's `.archimedes/`, under
the no-commit guarantee (see `internal/spawn/materialize.go`).

### Terminal workspace integration (opt-in)

`spawn` can also hand the finished worktree to a terminal workspace
manager, so a new unit of work arrives in a pane already rooted at its own
checkout instead of needing a manual `cd`. It is off unless you turn it on:

```
export ARCHIMEDES_WORKSPACE=herdr   # instance-wide, in your shell profile
archimedes spawn widget-fix target --workspace herdr   # or just this once
archimedes spawn widget-fix target --workspace off     # ...or not this once
archimedes spawn widget-fix target --focus             # and switch to it
```

[herdr](https://herdr.dev) is the one integration implemented today
(`internal/workspace`). It's invoked as `herdr worktree open`, adopting the
checkout git already made rather than creating a second one, and labelled
`<repo>:<slug>` — the same shape `--stack-on` parses — because one slug can
be spawned into several repos. herdr also opens a workspace for the parent
repo if it doesn't already have one; that's its own worktree model, not
something spawn asks for.

Without `--focus` the new workspace opens in the background, so a spawn
never yanks you out of what you were doing — including a sweep that spawns
one slug across several repos in a row.

The integration is best-effort by construction. By the time it runs, the
branch, the worktree, its materialized context, and its status row all
exist, so a workspace manager that isn't installed, or whose server isn't
running, degrades to a warning on stderr and a successful spawn. The one
thing that is an error is naming an integration that doesn't exist: a typo
fails loudly rather than silently withholding the pane you asked for.

Adding another workspace manager means adding a case to
`workspace.Select` and an `Opener` beside `openHerdr`. Everything above
`internal/workspace` — `spawn`, the flags, the warning path — is written
against the `Integration` type, not against herdr.

`status` reads every `work/<slug>/status.md`, looks up each row's live PR
state via `gh pr list`, and prints the same fixed-width table the shell
script did (or `--json` for a machine-readable report). A row's PR lookup
degrading to "no PR" — a missing `gh` auth, no network, an unset repo — never
fails the rest of the report, matching the original script's `|| echo '{}'`
fallback.

`prune` removes worktrees, branches, and status rows for units of work whose
PR has merged or closed. It's a dry run unless `--force` is passed, and it
refuses to remove a branch still acting as another unit of work's stacked
base.
